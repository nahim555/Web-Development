	The Norfolk Broads National Park is one the largest protected areas of wetland amidst Norfolk's area of outstanding natural beauty. 
	There are large open shallow broads linked by rivers and navigable waterways with surrounding reed beds and marshes.</p>

<p>The square area of the Norfolk Broads totals 303 kilometres, most of this is in Norfolk. 
The Broads themselves all sixty three of them, can be as small as a pond or large expanses of water and most are to be found in the northern part of the Broads, but some of the southern reaches of the rivers and broads meander into Suffolk. 
Most of the Broads are less than four metres deep and whilst thirteen of them are completely navigable, another three have a navigable channel running through them, but the rest are not navigable.</p>

<p>It is truly a unique place with a wide variety of wildlife and breath-taking scenery that is waiting for you to discover next time you have a day out on the Norfolk Broads.</p>

	Exactly 100 years ago, the Great Yarmouth Council invited tenders for what was then known as the shelter hall. It was going to be part of a general improvement and landscaping which, with an open air bandstand, would transform Gorleston from a fishing village to a seaside resort. But there were councillors who opposed the plans and wanted the money spent on housing improvements instead.

The Pavilion plan survived and the borough engineer, J.W. Cockrill, came up with an imposing Italian-style terracotta building, which opened a year later. Keith Prowse, later of ticket agency fame, was the first lessee, offering band concerts before Geroge Gilbert - the horse-man and showman behind the Hippodrome Circuses in Yarmouth and Lowestoft - took over the running for five years. He showed films in a building which has proved its versatility down the years.</p>
